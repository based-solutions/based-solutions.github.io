          This Privacy Policy explains how the mobile application <strong>Qshi</strong> (hereinafter
          “Qshi”, “the app”, “we”, or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses information about you when
          you use our app, in accordance with Google Play requirements. By using the app, you agree
          to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

          Information We Collect
          <span class="section-badge">Data</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We do <em>not</em> collect any information that directly identifies you (such as your name,
          address, phone number, or email). However, the app does automatically collect certain data
          about your device and how you use the app. This information includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Information about your interactions with the app, such
            as features you use, content you view, and actions you take (for example, app launches,
            taps, menu selections, and session duration).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>App Performance and Diagnostics:</strong> Technical data about the app’s
            performance on your device. This includes crash logs, error reports, and other
            diagnostic information (e.g. app launch times, battery usage, and network performance).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Unique identifiers associated with your device,
            such as your device’s Android Advertising ID or other device IDs. We also collect your
            device’s IP address, which may be used to estimate your general location (country or
            region).

          How We Use Your Information
          <span class="section-badge">Usage</span>
        </h2>
        <p>We collect and use the above information to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide and Improve Services:</strong> Understand how users interact with our
            app, diagnose technical issues, and improve the app’s functionality and user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics:</strong> Analyze usage patterns and app performance. For example, we
            may review aggregated usage data to determine which features are most popular.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advertising:</strong> Serve and personalize advertisements in the app through
            the Google AdMob platform. The data collected (such as device identifiers and usage
            data) helps display relevant ads to you and perform advertising-related analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Protect the integrity of our services,
            prevent fraud, and maintain a secure environment for our users.

          Third-Party Services and Data Sharing
          <span class="section-badge">Third Parties</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We use certain third-party services that collect data on our behalf or receive data from
          our app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob (Advertising):</strong> Our app uses Google AdMob SDK to serve ads.
            AdMob may collect and share some of the information listed above (including device
            identifiers, IP address, and app usage data) for the purpose of advertising and
            analytics. AdMob and its advertising partners may use cookies or similar tracking
            technologies (such as mobile device identifiers and beacons) to display ads relevant to
            you. All data collected through AdMob is transmitted securely and encrypted in transit.
            Please see Google’s
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
              Privacy Policy
            </a>
            for more details on how Google collects and uses data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Play Services (In-App Purchases):</strong> If you choose to purchase a
            subscription or make in-app purchases, those transactions are processed by Google Play.
            We do not collect or store your financial information (such as credit card numbers).
            Payment and subscription data (e.g. transaction IDs and statuses) are handled by Google
            Play Services under Google’s policies. We only receive information necessary to verify
            and provide your purchase (for example, confirmation that you have a valid subscription).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Aside from the third parties above, we do not share your personal data with any other
          companies, organizations, or individuals, except as required by law or in the good faith
          belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our
          rights, or ensure users’ safety.

          Data Security
          <span class="section-badge">Security</span>

        <p>
          We are committed to protecting your data. We implement reasonable security measures to
          safeguard the information collected through our app. For example, data transmissions are
          secured using encryption protocols (HTTPS/TLS) to protect your data in transit between
          your device and our servers or third-party services. Please note, however, that no method
          of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot
          guarantee absolute security.

          Data Retention and Deletion
          <span class="section-badge">Retention</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          We retain the collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in
          this Privacy Policy (for example, to maintain and improve the app, or as required for
          legal and accounting purposes). Anonymous or aggregated data that does not identify an
          individual user may be retained for longer periods for analytics purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Because our app does not require you to create an account
          or provide personal identifying information, there is currently no in-app mechanism to
          request deletion of data collected by the app. If you wish to stop any future data
          collection, you can uninstall or stop using the app. Please be aware that data already
          collected (such as diagnostic logs or advertising identifiers) may continue to be retained
          as part of aggregated analytics or by our third-party providers (like Google) in
          accordance with their own data retention policies. We will update this policy if we add a
          data deletion option in the future.

        <p>
          Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect
          personal information from children. In the event that we learn we have inadvertently
          collected data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from
          our records. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that a child under 13 may
          have provided us with information, please contact us so we can promptly address the issue.
