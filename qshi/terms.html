            This Terms of Use agreement (“Terms”) is a legal agreement between you and
            <strong>Based Solutions</strong> (“Company,” “we,” or “us”), the provider of the
            <strong>Qshi</strong> mobile application (“Qshi” or “the app”).
            These Terms govern your access to and use of Qshi. By downloading, installing,
            or using Qshi, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with
            any part of these Terms, you must not use the app.

          <p>
            Qshi is rated <strong>3+</strong> and intended for users of all ages. However,
            if you are under the age of 18 (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction),

            to these Terms on your behalf. By using Qshi, you affirm that you are at least 3 years
            old and, if you are a minor, that your parent or guardian has reviewed and agreed to

          <h2>5. Subscription Terms and Purchases <span class="badge">Billing</span></h2>
          <p>
            Qshi may offer certain features or content through in-app purchases or subscription services.
            If you choose to make a purchase or subscribe to paid content within Qshi, you agree to the
            following terms:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment:</strong> All payments for in-app purchases or subscriptions are processed
              through Google Play using your Google Play account. You must have a valid payment method on
              file with Google Play. By initiating a purchase or subscription, you authorize Google Play to
              charge your provided payment method for the applicable fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Subscription Auto-Renewal:</strong> If you purchase a subscription, it will
              automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle (e.g. monthly or annually) and you will
              be charged the subscription fee unless you cancel before the next renewal date. The subscription
              terms, including the price, billing period, and automatic renewal, will be disclosed to you at
              the time of purchase. By subscribing, you acknowledge and agree that recurring charges will be
              billed to your Google Play account until you cancel the subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Managing Subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel your Qshi subscription at any
              time through your Google Play account settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Changes to Fees:</strong> We reserve the right to adjust the pricing of any subscriptions
              or in-app purchases. If the price of a subscription changes, we will notify you in advance (for
              example, via Google Play or in-app notification). Any price changes will apply only to future
              billing cycles (e.g. to renewals or new subscriptions) and not retroactively to the current term.
              If you do not agree to a price change, you may cancel the subscription before the new price takes effect.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="s6">
          <h2>6. Cancellation and Refund Policy <span class="badge">Refunds</span></h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel a subscription, the cancellation will take effect at the
            end of your current billing period. You will continue to have access to subscription content until the
            end of the period you have already paid for, and you will not be charged again after that period ends.
            Canceling a subscription stops future payments but does not automatically entitle you to a refund for the
            current billing period.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Refunds:</strong> Purchases made through Qshi (including subscriptions) are generally
            non-refundable, except as described here or required by applicable law. All billing and refund
            transactions are handled via Google Play. If you request a refund within 48 hours of purchase, you may
            be eligible to receive a refund depending on the details of the purchase. To request a refund within
            this 48-hour window, please use the Google Play refund process. If more than 48 hours have passed since
            your purchase and you experience an issue or believe a refund is warranted, you should contact us at the
            email provided below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that users in some regions may have additional rights to cancel subscriptions and obtain refunds
            for the unused portion of a subscription, if such rights are provided under local law. Except as otherwise
            provided above, all charges for purchases are final and non-refundable. We do not offer refunds for partial
            use or remaining time on a subscription after cancellation, except where required by applicable law.

            To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Based Solutions or its directors, officers, employees,
            agents, partners, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages
            of any kind. This includes, without limitation, any loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or other intangible

            of Qshi in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. Some jurisdictions do not
            allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so the above limitations may not fully apply to you.

            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to Qshi at any time, with or without prior notice, if you fail
            to comply with these Terms or if we decide to discontinue the app (or any part of it). If we terminate or suspend your
            access, your right to use Qshi will immediately cease. You may also discontinue use of Qshi at any time by uninstalling

            Any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including but not limited to provisions
